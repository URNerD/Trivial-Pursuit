# Trivial Pursuit

Create questions and answers to make cards for a Web Design version of Trivial Pursuit.
Each card has six questions. One from each of the categories below. The questions go on one side
and the answers go on the other.

To make it easy to convert your work into cards, create a repository called Trivial Pursuit on
GitHub and enter your questions, answers, and evidence into a file. Each line represents one question.
Use a tab character betwen each part. Leave a blank line between each "card".

Each line would look like this:

Category<tab>Question<tab>Answer<tab>Evidence<return>

* Category is the code in parenthesis from the list below.
* <tab> is a tab character.
* Question is your question.
* Answer is the correct answer.
* Evidence is the URL or other source where you prove you are right.
* <return> is the return key to start a new line.
